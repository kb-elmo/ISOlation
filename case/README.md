# ISOlation case

### These files are meant for 3D printing only! 

They are not suitable for CNC machining and trying to use them for that will most likely result in failure of the parts.

The bottom part is a simple friction fit into the top part.  
Make sure that everything works and is installed properly on the PCB when putting the case together.  
Removing the bottom piece later is not really easy.
